# Heat-Exchangers
Some relatively general code for specific shell and tube heat exchangers

## Contents Description

- `main.py` contains functions which simulate aspects of heat exchangers.

- Only specific heat exchanger designs are currently implimented, including:
  - Air cooled (single tube pass)
  - Cross flow (2 tube passes)
  - Countercurrent flow (2 tube passes)
  - Kettle vaporizer (single tube pass)
  - Turbine (Generalized efficiency curve)
  - Pump (Pump curves through fitted polynomials)

changing tube passes or flow arrangement would be relatively easy.
All exchangers can handle liquids or gases except vaporizer shell side.
 - Gases condensing on the shell side can be problematic
